# 人类和计算机记忆提取过程的异同

# Background

## Primary Issue for Both

- Without fast access to information stored in memory, both humans and computers could not make instantaneous actions. 
- Accessing the wrong information could lead humans and computers to either perform the wrong actions or spend additional time trying to retreive the correct information.
- Thus, a primary issue for both computer and human information retreival is how to access the correct information efficiently.

## The Issue Central

- Psychologist struggle to build representations and models to explain how humans retreive information.
- As for computers, people try to develop the best method to retreive information.
- Thus, an issue central for both is determining how to represent information and what method to use to retreive the information.

## The Purpose of Comparison

- As there are improvements in information retreival methods, these improvements may suggest new ways of modeling the representation and retreival of information from memory.
- We may find more effective methods of retreiving information from computers through a greater understanding of how the human memory retreival system works.

# Stages of Retrieval

- ***Generating*** and ***assembling*** the retreival cues
	- Cues need to be transmitted to the computer, while in human retrieval, the generated cues are used automatically.
- Using the cues to ***retrieve*** information
	- The actual retreive process is automatic in both cases.
- ***Verifying*** that the retreived information is what is desired.

# Human Memory Retrieval Models

## Automatic Retrieval

### Compound Cue Models

Assumes associative connections between retrieval cues and items in memory.

- Search of Associative Memory (SAM) Model
	- Initially uses only general context as the intitial cue to retrieve an initial item. It thn uses that item as a new cue to retrievean additional item. This process continues until a certain number of failures to retrieve any new items occurs.
	- Automatic and not under the control of consciousness.
	- The model highlights the concept that retrieval of relevant information is primarilyased on the associations between information stored in memory and their cues.

### Spreading Activation Models

Assumes a semantic network in which items in memory are highly interconnected. The connections between memory items are typically represented as the semantic relationships between the items with different strengths based on the semantic relatedness.

Initial items are activated by the cues given. The activation of these initial items then spreads along the semantic connections to activate other associated items.

### Distributed Models

Information is represented as a vector of features rather the nodes in which a concept is stored.

### Summary

All the models have some basic underlying similarities for retrieval.

Items of information are encoded using some form of associations between the items and other information encoded with them.

Cue-dependence are displayed in these models.

## Strategic Retrieval

Retrieval is not just the process of searching a series of memory items given certain cues to see which items best match the cues. A context for the retrieval must be established through the use of strategies. For a retrieval, a person not only uses the word cue that was provided, but also a lot of the additional context of the situation when the original word was encoded for the retreival. As information is retreived, it too can serve as a context for retrieving additional information.

# Computer Information Retrieval

Core problem: How do we retrieve what we want efficiently while minimizing the retrieval of undesired information?
