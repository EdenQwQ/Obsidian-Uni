## Between-subject Design

> A between-subject design (组间设计) is an experiment that has two or more groups of subjects each being tested by a different testing factor simultaneously.

### Experimental blinds

In order to avoid experimental bias, experimental blinds are usually applied in between-subject designs.

1. Single blind: Keep the subject blind without identifying them as members of the treatment group or the control group. A placebo is usually offered to the control group members.
2. Double blind: Both the subjects and the testers are unaware of the subjects' group. This can protect the experiment from the [[Observer-expectancy Effect]].

### Advantages

Multiple variables can be tested simultaneously. Saves time.

### Disadvantages

Complex. Requires a large amount of participants. Easily cause bias such as [[Observer-expectancy Effect|observer-expectancy bias]] and [[Subject-expectancy Effect|subject-expectancy bias]].

## Within-subject Design 

>Repeated measures design (aka. within-subject design (被试内设计) ) is a research design that involves multiple measures of the same variable taken on the same or matched subjects either under different conditions or over two or more time periods.

### Advantages 

Reduces the number of participants. Efficient. Longitudinal analysis.

### Disadvantages 

Order effect may occur, but can be counterbalanced with crossover design (randomly order different conditions for each participant).
