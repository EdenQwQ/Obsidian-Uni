>The observer-expectancy effect (观察者期望效应) is a form of reactivity in which a researcher's cognitive bias causes them to subconsciously influence the participants of an experiment. [[Confirmation Bias]] can lead to the experimenter interpreting results incorrectly because of the tendency to look for information that conforms to their hypothesis, and overlook information that argues against it. It is a significant threat to a study's internal validity, and is therefore typically controlled using a double-blind experimental design.
