# Thoughts

## Thoughts on the research purpose

 - The research is inspired by a common phenomenon in real life. And the researchers are curiosity and rigorous enough to record the phenomenon and deeply dig into its mechanism, which is impressive and worth learning.
 - The researchers start with reviewing former researches and concluding their strategies and limitations. Then they start carrying out their own experiments with strong purpose in mind.

## Thoughts on the design

 - The experiments are well designed to best eliminate bias and obtain useful data. Examples:
	 - Boards used in [[Slope Perception Failure (Summary)#Experiment 1|Experiment 1]] and [[Slope Perception Failure (Summary)#Experiment 3 A|Experiment 3 A]] are curved on the edge to prevent the help of linear perspective.
	 - A questionnaire is used in [[Slope Perception Failure (Summary)#Experiment 3 A|Experiment 3 A]] to eliminate the possible [[Observer-expectancy Effect|observer-expectancy effect]].

 - The experiments are well designed to exclude unreliable factors. Examples:
	 - Viewing distance is excluded by using the Far-control group in [[Slope Perception Failure (Summary)#Experiment 2 A|Experiment 2 A]].
	 - Experiments are conducted to exclude the effect of the weight of the device in [[Slope Perception Failure (Summary)#Experiment 2 B|Experiment 2 B]].
	 - Retinal size is excluded by comparing small and large boards in [[Slope Perception Failure (Summary)#Experiment 3 A|Experiment 3 A]].

 - The researchers are continuously realizing their own limitations in the design of each experiment and improve  them step by step to obtain the final conclusion rigorously.

# Questions

 - The discussion and conclusion part of the paper continuously mention the effect of coding efficiency. But this effect is not well discussed throughout the whole paper. What exactly is coding efficiency and how it is related to the perceptual error of optical slant?
 - The gain factor $k$ of the linear function of gaze declination and head orientation is well estimated. But what about the continuous function of optical slant ($f(\beta)$) ? How is it modeled and calculated?
 - Why is it OK to only require verbal estimates in [[Slope Perception Failure (Summary)#Experiment 2 A|Experiment 2 A]]? Is it intentional or due to the technological limitation of the VR device?
