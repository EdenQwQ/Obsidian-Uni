# Q1

>How is $f(\beta)$ calculated? [[Thoughts on the Study#Questions|May answer this]]

In Figure 7, each curve is actually $f(\beta)$ calculated with different given gain factor ($k$). The data in [[Slope Perception Failure (Summary)#Experiment 2 A| Experiment 2 A]] is used. We've measured $\alpha_p$, $\gamma_p$, $\gamma$, and $\beta$ with both the far group and the near group. Each data point is dotted on the graphic with the gain factor for gaze orientation set to different numbers between 1 and 3 respectively. The break between each curve separates the far group and the near group. As seen in the graphic, when $k$ is set to $2.0$, the curve is more continuous and the dots are more closely distributed near the curve. This is the methodology used when two functions are unknown and one of them is considered to be linear while the other one is continuous.

# Q2

>Why is a matching slope used in [[Slope Perception Failure (Summary)#Experiment 1|Experiment 1]]? Isn't there a misperception of the matching slope as well?

The experiment aims to figure out the qualitative relationship between the perceived slant and the viewing position. Thus, the comparison between the angle of the matching board and the reference board is enough to indicate the relationship. There is no quantitative measurement required in this experiment.

# Q3

>While all the dots are above the reference line in Figure 2, why are some dots under the reference line in Figure 10?

This is related to [[Slope Perception Discussions#Q2]]. Data in [[Slope Perception Failure (Summary)#Experiment 1|Experiment 1]] are measured by using the matching slope, while the ones in [[Slope Perception Failure (Summary)#Experiment 3 A|Experiment 3 A]] are by using the line on the screen. The measurement is different, and each has bias. The data are okay to use as long as they show a difference between far and near groups.

>What is code efficiency mentioned in the article's discussion part? How is it related to the content?
