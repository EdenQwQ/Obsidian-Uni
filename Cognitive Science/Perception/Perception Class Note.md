# Theories of Perception

## Perception Representation 知觉表征

Von Helmholtz: Perception is a process of integration, an unconscious inference. Analysis + Integration.

## [[Gestalt Psychology]] 格式塔理论

强调整体性

Psychology phenomenon is a well-organized comprehensive structure. The whole is greater than the sum of its parts.

## Ecological Psychology 生态心理学

强调外界刺激属性

Perception is a subjective exploration of the environment. It extracts the immutability and stability from the environment.

Perception is direct and natural.

E.g. [[Optical Flow]]

# Perceptual Process

> Sensation → Perceptual Organization → Identification & recognition

Perception is a multichannel [^1] process. This is concluded by studying brain damage patients whose sensation channels are normal, but the integration partition is abnormal.

## [[Perception Class Note#Theories of Perception#Gestalt Psychology 格式塔理论|Gestalt]]

Mind forms a global “whole” with self-organizing tendencies. The ability to separate background and foreground is inherent.

### Gestalt Laws of Grouping

[[Gestalt Psychology#Prägnanz]]

Law of proximity: Proximate objects are more likely to be identified as the same object.

Law of similarity: Similar objects are more likely to be identified as the same object.

Law of closure: Kanizsa Triangle

Law of symmetry: Images are more commonly interpreted as symmetrical identities.

Law of continuity: Images are more commonly interpreted as the combination of continuous parts.

Law of common fate: Elements moving together tend to be perceived as a unified group.

Law of good gestalt: The entire comes the first and then the parts if the entire is not good.

## Top-down Processing

Perception is affected by expects.

### Context Effect 情景效应

The influence of environmental factors on one's perception of a stimulus. Context effect employ top-down design when analyzing information. Top-down design fuels understanding of an image by using prior experiences and knowledge to interpret a stimulus.

## Perceptual Constancy

The perception of an object or quality as constant even though our sensation of the object changes. While the physical characteristic of an object may not change, in an attempt to deal with the external world, the human perceptual system has mechanisms that adjust to the stimulus.

### Visual Constancy

- Size constancy
- Shape constancy 
- Color constancy 
- Brightness constancy 
- Distance constancy 
- Location constancy 

### Auditory Constancy

- Musical instrument
- Speech

Lack of perceptual cues lead to misperception.

## Depth Perception

### Depth Cues

- Occlusion 遮挡
- Relative size
- Familiar size 
- Texture gradients size/density 纹理梯度
- Linear perspective
- Relative motion [^2]
- Relative clarity 相对清晰度
- Lens accommodation 晶状体调节

Depth perception is acquired. Concluded by studying tribes in African forests.

[^1]: E.g. As for visual sensation, colors, shapes, directions and other properties are processed separately in different channels.

[^2]: Further objects moves slower than nearer ones when the observer is moving.
