# Abstract

- In the article the authors develop a rigorous(‰∏•Ê†ºÁöÑ) procedure for deciding the scheduling problem in visual search by making improvements in both search methodology and data interpretation.
- The search method generalized the traditional single-target methodology by permitting multiple targets.

# Introduction

## Problem

- The central problem of attention research:
	- Developing principled accounts of serial and parallel processing
- The visual search method on which the early theories were built is inherently not able to distinct serial and parallel search.

## Approach and Findings

- The approach involves extensive brute-force(Êö¥ÂäõÁ†¥Ëß£) simulation of a multiple-target search (MTS) method. This method mentioned as a possible resolution to the pitfalls of single-target search (STS).
- Findings 
	- Many searching tasks once presumed to be serial are in fact better explained as capacity-limited parallel processes.
	- Contrary to common belief, not all small set-size searches are parallel. It is possible to reliably resolve a class of search problems with serial element scheduling.

# Historical Method

## Single-Target Visual Search

- Most common version of the experiment:
	- Participants conduct quick searches to determine whether a single target element is or is not present in a display of distractions. The average RT to make this decision is plotted as a function of the number of total elements (set size = 1 + number of distractions).
- Difficult searches:
	- Attention limitation is inferred from the target-present latency.
	- The search becomes difficult and time-consuming when the target is well camouflaged(‰º™Ë£Ö) within distractions.
	- RT increases with SS. When this increase is substantial (linear function of SS, with a slope of approximately 20-50 ms per additional item), the implication is that the search is difficult and attention-demanding.
- Easy searches:
	- The target is so obvious that it pops out within distractions.
	- This happens in searches based on differences in color, motion, orientation, size, luminance, and other feature dimensions know to be processed early in visual cortex. 
	- The RT function is flat as there is no cost associated with SS.
	- Flat RT functions were originally thought to define parallel processes.
- Shortcomings:
	- Theoretical
		- SS effects and search slopes higher than zero are not necessary indications of serial processes. A parallel process might suffer costs of divided attention, which would lead to serial-appearing RT functions.
	- Practical
		- Many experiments use a set size of (1 to 4) to (24 or more). Though these ranges may statistically estimate the search slope, they may introduce visual artifacts (ËßÜËßâ‰º™ÂΩ±) such as masking and low acuity(ÊïèÈîêÂ∫¶) in the periphery(Â§ñÂë®). These artifacts are shown to undermine a clear interpretation of RT slopes.

## Multiple-Target Visual Search 

- MTS is an extension of STS that, under appropriate constraints(Á∫¶ÊùüÊù°‰ª∂), decouples(Ëß£ËÄ¶) capacity limitation from processing protocol.
- MTS augments(Êâ©ÂÖÖ) the standard method by including trials with more than one target. Participants' tasks are to indicate whether any targets are present. The extension generates key diagnostic conditions known as pure-target trials where all the elements on the display is a target, which is a critical feature of MTS.
- Benefits:
	- If target-present RT decreases as pure-target number increases, then processing is parallel.
		- Serial processing must have flat RT functions as the search would always terminate when the first element is identified as the target.
		- Standard parallel models predict a decreasing RT function whether do to statistical considerations or via spatial pooling of evidence across channels.
