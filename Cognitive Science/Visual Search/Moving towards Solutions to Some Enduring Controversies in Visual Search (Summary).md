- The common fact of visual search studies: Some search tasks are easy and others are difficult.
- Reason to study human search behavior:
	- improve performance in critical applied search tasks
	- offer suggestions to those trying to build machines that might do our search tasks for us
	- tractable way to study selective attention

- Treisman **Feature Integration Theory** (FIT)
	- A two-stage solution to the problem of visual search:
		- A **preattentive**(ÂâçÊ≥®ÊÑè) stage that could process a limited number of basic features in **parallel**
			- Preattentive search for a target defined by a single basic feature would produce reaction times (RTs) independent of the number of items in the display (set size). The slope of the function relating RT to set size would be near zero.
		- An attentive stage that could perform more complex acts of recognition, one object at a time
			- Marshal(ÊèêÊê∫) the more extensive perceptual capabilities required to bind features together.
	- Issues
		- What is preattentive processing, and how is it related to 'early vision' and to attentive vision?
		- Why can't we decide if visual search is a serial or a parallel process?
		- What is the role of memory in visual serach?

- The nature of preattentive processing 
	- Hypothesis: Basic features that could be processed preattentively were the same as the features of 'early vision' that were being found to excite neurons in primary or extra-striate visual cortex.
		- The preattentive stage's representation of orientation does not seem to be the same as early vision's representation.
		- Preattentive processes seem unable to use the full capabilities of early visual processing of orientation.
		- Preattentive processes may only use information about the categorical status of items. It is only easy to find a target if it is uniquely steep, shallow, tilted left or right.
		- Paradox: Preattentive processes seem to have properties associated with later stages of visual cortical processing. Attentive processing seems to have access to the information held by cells in early visual cortex.
			- Visual pathway is not a one-way street.
			- Preattentive processing may represent a fast but relatively high-level abstraction of the visual scene. On that abstraction, attention selects specific objects for further processing. Part of further processing involves recalling the earlier stages of processing for the fine detail.
- Is search serial or parallel?
	- One solution:
		- Propose that search does not have a serial component.
		- Object recognition is accomplished by a parallel process that is capable of processing many items at once. Different types of parralel process can be devised that will produce the same patterns of data that led researchers to propose a serial self-terminating search.
	- Problem:
		- THere are many situations in which visual system uses selective attention to avoid processing all itmes at once.
	- Hybrid models
		- Metaphor: carwash
			- Cars enter the carwash in series but several cars are washed in parallel.
- The role of memory in visual search 
	- Do observers keep track of the course of a visual search? Models with aserial component like FIT and GS assume that items, once rejected as distractors, are not revisited in the course of a search.
	- Inhibition of Return (IOR)
		- Participants are inhibited in their effort to attend a previously attended location.
		- Klein: IOR makes visual search more efficient.
	- To disrupt IOR, we compared a standard serial search task with a dynamic version where every item was randomly repositioned every 100ms or so.
		- Slope of RT vs set size is about the same in dynamic and static conditions. The result suggest that IOR is not working in static condition either. So we argue that visual search has no memory for rejected distractions.
