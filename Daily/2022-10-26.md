## Memos

- 09:15 This is the second day of me using obsidian. I'll try to stick to it as my daily note app. 🤓
- 09:24 The first time for me to have a morning shower in uni. Feeling refreshed and clean. 🤩
- 11:55 Reading the paper is too boring. 🥱
- 13:37 Too happy to have finished reading Li Zhi's paper. Time to have a rest. 🙌
- 14:48 Again amazed by optical illusions shown in psychology class. 🤯
