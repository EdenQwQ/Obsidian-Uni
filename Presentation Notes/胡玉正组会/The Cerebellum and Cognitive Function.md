# Cerebellum

- Accounts for 10% of the total mass of the brain.

## Lobes

- Anterior lobe
- Posterior lobe
- Flocculonodular lobe

## Functions

### Traditional

- ËÑäÈ´ìÂ∞èËÑë
	- Control think and body movement
- ÂâçÂ∫≠Â∞èËÑë
	- Balance and ocular movements
- Â§ßËÑëÂ∞èËÑë
	- Modulates smooth and precise limb movements

### Perceptive

Cerebellum activation is detected during multiple perception processes. Indicating the necessary relationship between cerebellum and perception.

# Article 1 Parcellation of Cerebellum

## Method

Tasks over a broad range of sensorimotor, cognitive and social/affective processes.

Tasks are divided into two sets and multiple runs. Cerebellum activation is recorded during each task.

## Results

- Cerebellum activation is obviously detected during each task, and the activation is different for different tasks.
- Lobular boundaries do not reflect strong functional subdivisions in the cerebellum.

## Modelling

Convex non-negative matrix factorization is used to build a new model for cerebellum parcellation. The new model shows strong functional subdivisions.
To prevent bias, the model is calculated with set A and examined with set B. The calculated DCBC[^] for set B on the model is large enough.
The new parcellation outperformed the task-free parcellation in predicting functional boundaries on a novel set of task conditions.

## Application

- This parcellation scheme could be applied to identifying functional subdivisions of other regions, including the cerebrum.

# Article 2 Cerebellum in and Social Cognition

##  Background

The posterior cerebellum is involved in social activities.

Social mentalizing: The ability to inference other person's mental states based n their actions, such as their intention and beliefs.

Robust activation of the cerebellum is detected during social judgement, involving mentalizing.

## Method 

Participants are asked to sequence 4 pictures by time.
Other participants are asked to sequence 9 sentences with the following 4 kinds by time.

Pictures: 16 cartoon-like scenarios: 4 mechanical; 4 social script; 4 false belief events; 4 true belief events 

Mechanical: Person interacting with objects.
Social script: A single person acting social routines.
False belief: Person acting on a false belief (unaware of an event).
True belief: Remove the false belief component.
Control: Viewing 4 pictures and not asked to sort them.

## Results 

- Comparing sequential conditions to non-sequential control condition, cerebrum is associated with constructing action sequences in general.
- Cerebrum is more activated when false/true beliefs are involved in the events.

# Cerebellum in Working Memory

Cerebellum is proven to be important during the process of encoding and maintenance of working memory.
