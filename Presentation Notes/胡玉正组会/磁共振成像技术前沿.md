## Principle of Magnetic Resonance Imaging

质子磁化自旋固有频率：拉莫尔频率

Radiofrequency Pulse 引发共振

Blood-Oxygen-Level Dependent (BOLD) fMRI

Neural activity → Blood-oxygen-level increase → Detected by fMRI

## Application of MRI

Neural imaging is a general research method.

Neural imaging → Neural regulation

## Limitation of Traditional MRI

Low temporospatial resolution.

### Millisecond precision**

Mouse → B = 9.4 T → Stimulate beard → Fast imaging

Millisecond precise responses detected, and the incubation period is very close to neuronal strike (action potential).

### Method: DIANA

- Direct imaging of neuronal activity with high temporospatial resolution.
- High temporospatial resolution DIANA captures thalamocortical spike propagation.
- Optogenetic DIANA experiment: DIANA responses directly detect optogenetic stimulation-evoked spikes.
- BOLD-suppressed DIANA using 2D fast line-scan and its hypothesized contrast mechanism.
- Sublayer-specific DIANA responses reveal functionally distinct sublayer-specific microcircuits.

### Possible Mechanism of DIANA

T2 is influenced by concentration of $K^{+}$. Changes of T2 relaxation time reflects the permeability of cell membrane, which could reflect the position and direction of action potential.
