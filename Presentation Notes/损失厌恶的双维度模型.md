## Loss Aversion

Mechanism:

- computational ‚Üí cognitive ‚Üí neural 

Application:

- business psychiatry

### Mechanism

The tendency to prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent or larger gains. ÈÅøÂÆ≥Â§ß‰∫éË∂ãÂà©„ÄÇ

>‚ÄúThe concept of loss aversion was, I believe, our most useful contribution to the study of decision-making.‚Äù ---- Daniel Kahneman

The mixed-gamble paradigm indicates that a rational people in economics is not rational in psychology.

#### Two Biases

Valuation bias: possible loss is weighted more heavily than possible gain.

Response bias: intuitively avoid possible loss.

Ventral striatum fMRI: more suppressed when considering loss than stimulated when considering gain.

Norepinephrine system ÂéªÁî≤ËÇæ‰∏äËÖ∫ÊøÄÁ¥†: possible loss stimulates nervous emotion.

The two indicate the two bias may coexist.

To prove: treat decision-making as a time process.

#### Computational Modelling

**Drift Diffusion Model** (DDM): Decision-making as a nosy evidence-accumulation process.

$$RDV_t=RDV_{t-1}+(v_{G}\cdot Gain-v_{L}\cdot Loss + \varepsilon)$$$$ RDV_{0}=z $$

$$Valuation\ bias=\frac{v_{L}}{v_{G}}$$

$$Response\ bias = 0.5-z$$

Use **joint probability distribution** to estimate $z$, $v_{G}$ and ${v_{L}}$ for each participant.

Subjective equivalent point: gain is a little larger than loss.

#### Cognitive Approaches: Gaze Allocation and Pupil Dilation

##### Gaze Allocation

- Gaze allocation reflects and influences valuation.
- Gaze bias reflects valuation bias.
- Valuation bias varies with gaze.

##### Pupil Dilation

- Pupil dilation reflects mental efforts.
- Pupil dilation reflects response bias.
- Accepting a gamble requires more efforts.

#### Neural Approach: EEG

##### Response

- P3 is larger when accepting than rejecting gambles, which reflects response bias.
- Source: motor cortex.

##### Valuation

- P3 is larger when loss is smaller and when gain is larger, which reflects valuation bias.
- Source: striatum (reward circuit).

#### Developmental Project

Loss aversion increases with age.

The development of the two biases are not linear and not synchronized. Response bias develops faster at earlier ages, while valuation bias develops faster after 15 years old.

### Application

#### Endowment Effect

- Endowment Effect: the highest willing price when buying is lower than the lowest willing price when selling.
- Conventional explanation: valuation bias (weighting losses over gains.)
- Valuation bias: The deal is made more often when the both the buyer and the seller concentrate on their gains. ‚Üí Good deals can be made by leading the buyer and seller to concentrate on their gains.
- Response bias: A successful deal takes more efforts when.
